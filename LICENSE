----------------------------------

This part of the intellij plugin project is free and open source,
but we reserve the right to have a private fork adding new features
including the ones available here only available to the sponsors
of the project temporarily or permanently but with the possibility
to reach the public version eventually.

If you contribute to this project you accept that your contributions
will be available in that private fork too that will be the plugin
published into the IntelliJ Plugin Store but your contributions will
be free to everyone.
